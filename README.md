The Ruby skin is for players who completed level 4 on the difficult path. All of the skin textures are generated by stable diffusion and applied in the game. The game includes a Fire skin, Green Magma skin, Lava skin, Ruby skin and the Default purple skin.

Every level unlocks after completing the level before it no matter the difficulty. The data is saved on the users Android and every level will still be unlocked that they have completed when they quit the game.
